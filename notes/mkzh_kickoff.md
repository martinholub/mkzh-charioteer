# Real Time Occupancy Rate
Real time data on all vehicles (bus, trams, boats?)
# City forest visitiors
Lot of entry points to big area
No concrete idea how many people come in
- Where people tend to stay/linger
- Which roads are used more / is there more roads? Trend detection
- Conflict detection
- Resources allocation justification
- Mind people/data security!
PubliBike
- No docking station
- Bike is wirelessly connected to the station point
- Lot of bikes lausanne
- Need to track bikes that are left behind, possibly without battery
- Can be unlocked with any RFID card
- Must be easy to install
- Dont use bike battery
- better than 50 m accuracy
- has slack
Coquering the last mile
- not presented
Teachers calling (stakeholder not present)
- Needs to be silent
- Students cant use cellphones, teacher should not be focusing on cellphone
(could use that older people hear at different freq)
- would be nice if the person has some GPS location 
Distribution challenge (ewz)
- power failure at homes --- they cannot see it
- customers must conntact help center
- putting sensor to distribution cabing may be an option.
- only 2000 cabins in ZH (solution should scale/ 100chf per cabin maximum)
- every 10 days there is a power outage ... what about some stats
  - civil engineering work (shoould alert the workers), svere weather
- space is limited
